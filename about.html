      <p>The Shaolin Temple is a Buddhist monastery, originally built on Songshan in 495 AD. Monks at 

Shaolin have practiced Chan Buddhism and martial arts for nearly its entire history. The most often 

told story for the origin of Shaolin Kung Fu is that the Indian monk Bodhidarma came to Shaolin in 

527 AD and upon finding the monks too physically weak to practice long periods of meditation 

introduced a series of physical exercises, variously said to be based on animal and farming 

movements.  However, there are also records which state that some of the earliest monks were expert martial artists, perhaps indicating a former military life.  Throughout the temple’s history it has 

been a refuge for many former military personnel, leading to a continual influx of new martial skills.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
	<br>
      <p>During the Sui dynasty (581-618) Shaolin Kung Fu was formed into its own distinct system which has

developed continually ever since. Throughout their history Shaolin monks have been involved in 

combat, defending the temple against bandits and at times being caught up in political conflicts. The 

long association of Chan Buddhism and martial arts at the temple has led to Shaolin Kung Fu forming 

an essential part of Buddhist practice there. The practice of kung fu is often regarded as a form of 

moving meditation.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
	<br>
      <p>Throughout its history the Shaolin Temple has been destroyed and rebuilt many times, at some

points remaining derelict for some time. More recently it was burned in 1928, destroying a significant portion of the temple, and the monks were subjected to persecution during the Cultural Revolution.

During these periods the Shaolin monks lived amongst the communities of Songshan, helping to 

further spread Shaolin Kung Fu throughout the area.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
	<br>
      <p>In the 1980’s the rebuilding of the temple began, with many monks returning. During this time the 

popularity of Shaolin Kung Fu grew and it became internationally recognised for its mix of traditional 

forms and acrobatics.<p>

Shaolin is also well known for its practitioner’s fitness, flexibility and body conditioning; our training 

has been designed to allow quick progress in these areas whilst ensuring safe and balanced 

development. Whilst many exercise routines focus almost entirely on the larger muscles, we include strengthening of the joints matched with carefully planned introduction of techniques to avoid injury.

Shaolin Kung Fu’s long history has seen it influenced by many martial arts practitioners from all over China, making it a vast system of self-defence. Our syllabus is therefore wide ranging and includes; traditional fist and weapon forms, each of which is its own sub-style or part of a sub-style, containing many practical applications; acrobatics which the Shaolin monks are famous for; Chin Na, which covers grappling and joint locks and Sanda, also known as Chinese kick boxing.

                    Shaolin Kung Fu originates from the Shaolin Temple in Henan, China. Whilst there are many styles of 

martial arts which make use of the Shaolin name, we train in the style practiced in the temple by the 

Shaolin monks. The almost unique experience of our instructors allows us to incorporate aspects of 

traditional Shaolin Kung Fu practiced by folk masters on Songshan mountain which are no longer 

practiced in the temple.
